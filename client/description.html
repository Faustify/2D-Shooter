      <h1> -------How to play the game? ---------- </h1>
      <p> This is a top-down 2D shooter. Aim the hull of your tank with your mouse (the tank hull will always rotate to face your mouse). Use the WASD keys to move your tank around the map (with W always bein up, A - left, S - down, D - right). Shoot your enemies by pressing Left - Mouse button when looking at them. Avoid being shot by moving around. Remember to aim carefully as after each shot there is a 2 second reload period. Win the game by having a higher score than your enemy after the time runs out. </p>
